# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project is dedicated to predicting the likelihood of heart disease using a range of machine learning algorithms. The aim is to develop a reliable model that can aid in early diagnosis and intervention.

Features
Logistic Regression: A fundamental binary classifier that predicts the probability of heart disease presence. Logistic Regression offers interpretability, making it suitable for understanding the impact of individual features on the prediction outcome.

Standard Scaler: Applied for feature scaling to ensure that all input features contribute equally to the model's performance. This preprocessing step is crucial for algorithms like SVC and Logistic Regression.

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. SVC is effective in handling complex decision boundaries in heart disease prediction.

Decision Tree Classifier: A non-parametric algorithm that splits the data into branches to make predictions. This model is intuitive and helps in understanding the decision-making process.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their outcomes for improved accuracy and robustness. Random Forest is particularly effective in reducing overfitting.

XGBClassifier: An advanced boosting algorithm that enhances prediction accuracy by combining the strengths of multiple weak learners. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance in classification tasks.

Confusion Matrix: Used to evaluate the performance of the models. The confusion matrix provides a breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which is essential for calculating additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
